1. 包管理工具

  homebrew

2. homebrew安装python3

安装命令：

  $ brew install python3

输出：

  ```py
  Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

  Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
  `python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin

  If you need Homebrew's Python 2.7 run
  brew install python@2

  Pip, setuptools, and wheel have been installed. To update them run
  pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

  You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
  They will install into the site-package directory
  /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages

  See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
  ```

然后就可以用python3命令了
